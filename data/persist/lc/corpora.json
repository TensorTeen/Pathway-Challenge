Our products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than 25 years ago. While Google Search started as a way to find web pages, organized into ten blue links, we have driven technical \nadvancements and product innovations that have transformed Google Search into a dynamic, multimodal experience. We first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search, making it easier to navigate on smaller \nscreens. As new types of content surfaced on the internet, Universal Search made it possible to search multiple \ncontent types, like news, images, videos, and more, to deliver rich, relevant results. The introduction of new search \nmodalities, like voice and visual search, made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive \nways.
